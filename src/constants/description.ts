  " This is an on-chain community project. Everyone that wins an auction has to participate. The winner of the auction is mailed the printed and signed photo to keep, along with the camera, and camera case The winner then takes a picture with the provided camera, prints and signs the image, and mails the signed print and camera in camera case, back to me with the prepaid label. (If winner chooses to, they can decorate a small portion of the camera case). I list the new image for sale as a collaboration with the creator of the latest image. They get 90% of the sale, and 10% goes to me to cover mailing and film costs. At the end of this project, we have an on-chain collective art piece and story we created together. Enjoy!";
